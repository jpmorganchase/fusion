# Installation

## Stable release

To install PyFusion, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install pyfusion
```

This is the preferred method to install PyFusion, as it will always install the most recent stable release. Documentation of changes made during each release can be found in the [Changelog](changelog.md).

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed, this [Python installation guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for PyFusion can be downloaded from
the [Github repo](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion).

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion
```

Or download the [tarball](https://www.makeuseof.com/extract-tar-gz/):

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```

# Storing Credentials

In order to connect to the Fusion API via SDK, we recommend storing your credentials in a JSON file. This file can be generated using Fusionâ€™s application registration page.

Your credentials file should be located in a directory accessible from the location you are using the SDK.
By default, the SDK will look for the credentials file at the path ``'config/client_credentials.json'``.

## Formatting Credentials File

Your credentials file should be formatted as follows.

```python
{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "resource": "",
    "auth_url": "",
    "proxies": {}
}
```

- **client_id**: Generated using Fusion's application registration page.
- **client_secret**: Generated using Fusion's application registration page.
- **resource**: Can be found on Fusion's calling the API page.
- **auth_url**: Can be found on Fusion's calling the API page.
- **proxies**: HTTP and HTTPS proxy values. Optional.

!!! warning "Populating Proxies"
    If your application is running behind a proxy, for example a corporate firewall, then the ``proxies`` value will also need to be defined. For example:
        ``"proxies" : {"http": "http://proxy.myfirm.com:8080", "https": "https://proxy.myfirm.com:8080"}``
    
    If you do not require proxies, either remove this argument or leave it as an empty dictionary ``{}``.


# Usage 

## Import Fusion

To begin using pyfusion, simply execute the import below.

```python
from fusion import Fusion
```
## Fusion Object

Connection to the Fusion platform can be easily established by instantiating a ``Fusion()`` object.

This object will act as a Fusion client, managing your credentials and connectivity to the API. This client also provides an extensive list of methods for browsing, retrieving, and creating metadata and data.

If your credenitals are stored in ``'config/client_credentials.json'``, you can instantiate your client as follow:

```python
fusion = Fusion()
```

If your credentials are stored in an alternative location, you can provide the appropriate path as the ``credentials`` argument:

```python
fusion = Fusion(credentials="path/to/my/credentials.json")
```

Alternatively, if you wish to provide your credentials directly to the client, you can utilize the ``FusionCredentials`` object:

```python
from fusion import FusionCredentials

credentials = FusionCredentials(
    client_id="<CLIENT_ID>",
    client_secret="<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    resource="<RESOURCE>"
)

fusion = Fusion(credentials=credentials)

```

## View Available Methods

Once you have instantiated the client ``fusion``, running the following cell will display its available methods:

```python
fusion
```
The output will be a table containing the available methods along with a short description:
