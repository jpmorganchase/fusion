# Installation

## Stable release

To install PyFusion, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install pyfusion
```

This is the preferred method to install PyFusion, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed, this [Python installation guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for PyFusion can be downloaded from
the [Github repo](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion).

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion
```

Or download the [tarball](https://www.makeuseof.com/extract-tar-gz/):

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/jpmorganchase/fusion/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```
